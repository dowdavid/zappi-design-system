## Adding New Components

When adding a new component:

1. Create component directory:
   ```
   src/components/YourComponent/
   â”œâ”€â”€ YourComponent.tsx
   â”œâ”€â”€ YourComponent.css
   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
   ```

2. Use design tokens from `src/design-tokens/tokens.css`

3. Export component in `src/components/index.ts`

4. Import CSS in `src/lib.ts`

5. Add to `dev-preview.html` for testing

6. Update README.md with component documentation

## Design Tokens

- Always use CSS custom properties from `src/design-tokens/tokens.css`
- Don't hardcode colors, spacing, or typography
- Follow the existing naming conventions

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow existing component patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Include prop types and JSDoc comments
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
